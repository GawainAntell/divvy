Description: Divide taxonomic occurrence data into geographic regions of fair
    comparison, with three customisable methods to standardise area and extent.
    Calculate common biodiversity and range-size metrics on subsampled data.
    Background theory and practical considerations for the methods are described
    in Antell and others (2023) <doi:10.31223/X5997Z>.
