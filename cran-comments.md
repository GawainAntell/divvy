## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed extra white spaces in the DESCRIPTION text.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

* The following words are flagged as possibly misspelled in the DESCRIPTION:
  Antell (12:8), Subsampling (2:16), subsampled (10:61), customisable (9:28).
  These words are correct as-is, as they are my name, proper statistical terms,
  and standard British English spellings, respectively.
